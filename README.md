## ‚öôÔ∏è **Task 1: End-to-End (E2E) Automation Testing (Playwright)**

### **Overview**
For Task 1, I implemented E2E tests for user authentication using **Playwright**. The test cases cover valid and invalid login scenarios, along with testing a wrong password input.

### **Test Cases Implemented**
1. **Valid User Login:**
   - Scenario: A user logs in with valid credentials.
   - Action: Username: `kminchelle`, Password: `0lelplR`.
   - Expected Result: User is redirected to the dashboard with a welcome message or token.
   
2. **Invalid User Login (User Not Found):**
   - Scenario: A user tries to log in with an invalid username.
   - Action: Username: `invalidUser`, Password: `wrongPassword`.
   - Expected Result: Login attempt fails with an appropriate error message.
   
3. **Wrong Password Test:**
   - Scenario: A user enters the correct username but provides the wrong password.
   - Action: Username: `kminchelle`, Password: `wrongPassword`.
   - Expected Result: Login attempt fails with an appropriate error message.

### **Test Execution**
- To run the test, clone the repository and install the dependencies by running:
  ```bash
  npm install
